# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

Your portfolio website has been set up for GitHub Pages deployment! Here's what's been configured:

## Repository Created
âœ… **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/Suhas2194/portfolio-website  
âœ… **GitHub Pages URL**: https://Suhas2194.github.io/portfolio-website

## What's Been Done

### 1. Contact Form Migration
- Replaced backend contact form with Formspree integration
- Form submissions now work without a backend server
- Added proper headers for better reliability

### 2. Static Site Build
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Added SPA fallback (404.html) for client-side routing
- Configured proper base path for GitHub Pages subpath

### 3. Repository Setup
- Created GitHub repository with proper configuration
- GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the main branch
- Added automated build and deployment pipeline

## How to Deploy

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
1. Push your code to the GitHub repository
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site
3. Your site will be available at: https://Suhas2194.github.io/portfolio-website

### Option 2: Manual Deployment
1. Run the build: `npm run build`
2. Copy files: `cp -r dist/public portfolio-static`  
3. Add SPA fallback: `cp portfolio-static/index.html portfolio-static/404.html`
4. Add .nojekyll: `touch portfolio-static/.nojekyll`
5. Push the `portfolio-static` folder to your GitHub repository

## Contact Form Setup
The contact form now uses Formspree (ID: xpwaqgnj). Make sure to:
1. Verify your email address with Formspree
2. Configure spam protection if needed
3. Set up form notifications in your Formspree dashboard

## Files Created/Modified

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml` - Automated deployment

### Scripts
- `scripts/create-github-repo.js` - Repository creation
- `scripts/deploy-to-github.js` - Manual deployment helper
- `server/github-client.js` - GitHub API integration

### Component Updates
- `client/src/components/contact-section.tsx` - Updated to use Formspree

## Next Steps
1. Push your code to GitHub to trigger the first deployment
2. Verify your Formspree email address
3. Test the deployed site
4. Configure a custom domain if desired
